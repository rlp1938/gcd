.SH NAME

.P
\fBgcd\fR \- calculate great circle distance.

.SH SYNOPSIS

.P
\fBgcd\fR  lat1,long1 lat2,long2.

.SH DESCRIPTION

.P
\fBgcd\fR calculates great circle distance two points on the globe
defined by comma separated lat1,long1 and lat2,long2 and writes
that distance to \fIstdout\fR.

.P
The coordinates must be in degrees and decimal fractions of degrees.
The method fits well with the GPS ouputs of touch enabled devices and
also the copied coordinates from pinned locations on Google maps. For the
latter app the user must remove the space following the comma after
the latitude.

.P
Coordinates must be unsigned for locations in the northern and eastern
hemispheres, and signed negative in the southern and western hemispheres.
Google Maps takes care of this automatically and I'd expect that GPS
apps would do the same.

.SH OPTIONS

.P
There are no options.
