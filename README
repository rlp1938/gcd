README for gcd

gcd takes 2 parameters, lat1,long  lat2,long2 and calculates the great
circle distance between them in meters.
The coordinates must be specified in degrees and decimal fractions,
not minutes and seconds. The outputs from GPS apps and Google Maps are
in a suitable format for input to the program.

There is a manpage gcd.1, but there are no options including -h.
