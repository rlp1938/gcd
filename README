README for gcd

gcd takes 2 parameters, lat1,long  lat2,long2 and calculates the great
circle distance between them in meters.
The coordinates must be specified in degrees and decimal fractions,
not minutes and seconds. The outputs from GPS apps and Google Maps are
in a suitable format for input to the program.

There is a manpage gcd.1, but there are no options including -h.

ERRORS:
The formulae I use are based on a sphere which of course the Earth only
approximates. A consequence of this is that the results may be out by +-
5 meters per kilometer. I use it for a walking distance calculator and
in this use there will be additional errors when the roads walked are
not exactly straight. Naturally if there is a significant inflexion I
would calculate and sum the distances between these points.
